.SH SYNOPSIS
.B netrek-client-cow
[\fIoptions\fR] [\fIdisplay-name\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
This is a client for the multi-player game of Netrek.

Netrek is the probably the first video game which can accurately be 
described as a "sport."  It has more in common with basketball than
with arcade games or Quake.  Its vast and expanding array of tactics
and strategies allows for many different play styles; the best players
are the ones who think fastest, not necessarily the ones who twitch
most effectively.  It can be enjoyed as a twitch game, since the
dogfighting system is extremely robust, but the things that really set
Netrek apart from other video games are the team and strategic
aspects.  Team play is dynamic and varied, with roles constantly
changing as the game state changes.  Strategic play is explored in
organized league games; after 6+ years of league play, strategies are
still being invented and refined.

The game was created in 1988, and still has players, including some
people who have been playing for nearly as long as the game has
existed.

To start the client program, run netrek-client-cow, and a list of
servers will be displayed.
